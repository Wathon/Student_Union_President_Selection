# Student_Union_President_Selection


There are 20 students who are members of the Student Union. The Student Union Presidential
Election was held last month and students voted. The President's term is 2 Years. However, the
union doesn't know and has not announced the President yet. We'll count the total votes for
each student and find out who is the elected President.

The following are collected data.
1. data/students.csv
