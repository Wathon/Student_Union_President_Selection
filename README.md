# Student_Union_President_Selection


There are 20 students who are members of the Student Union. The Student Union Presidential
Election was held last month and students voted. The President's term is 2 Years. However, the
union doesn't know and has not announced the President yet. We'll count the total votes for
each student and find out who is the elected President.
